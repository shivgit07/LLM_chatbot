# LLM_chatbot
This is my project in which I have made a question answering chatbot for questions related to my college IIT Bomaby. It is based on retrieval augmented generation(RAG), by integrating Retrieval-based techniques with a LLM model
<br>
1. `Web_scraping.ipynb` and `SMP_scraping-.ipynb` files contains the data scraped from various websites of our college. All the scraped data was stored in a pdf file, which I haven't include in this repo.
2. `AML_project_model.ipynb` file is the main file that contains the process of loading and combining various models/techniques, using the scraped data, which was finally integrated into a Q&A pipeline, which is able to satisfactorially answer questions (some examples included at end).

> PS. The data I had scraped and used for training this chatbot belongs to IIT Bombay and its various organisations and bodies
