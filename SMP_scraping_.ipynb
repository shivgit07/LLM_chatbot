All cultural programs and activities are the responsibility of the Cult Council; likewise all sports events are managed by the Sports Council. The Mess Council looks after mess and canteen while the Maint Council ensures proper working of the common areas and the hostel maintenance. All the councils are supervised by the Hostel General Secretary (GSec - a fourthie or fifthie = big daddies). To oversee hostel funds and the Student Council, every hostel has a Hall Manager and a Warden and to assist them, there are Warden Nominees. Every hostel also has an Alumni Secretary to maintain cordial relations with the hostel alumni. Computer Secretary (Comp Secy) takes care of the Computer Room and Internet connection problems while Technical Secretary (Tech Secy) manages the Technical Events at hostel and institute level.

Blocks of some 10-15 rooms constitute a wing in each hostel and your wingmates (wingies) will be your immediate support group in more ways than one. We cherish the time we have spent with our wingies and we hope you do so too. Your wingies might be people from very diverse backgrounds but do not let that hinder interaction in any way. In fact, use it to your advantage. You would go with your wingies on intra hostel volley and cricket matches, treats (birthdays, crack acads, mentor's placement et al), treks, tours, hang-outs etc all the time. At the same time, socialize with other hostelers - batchmates and seniors alike - all the time. Also, ragging, simply, is a strict no no!

Each semester, you have to complete a certain number of credits/courses. Based on your performance, you are assigned a grade at the end of each course. The weighted average of your grade points for all the courses in a particular semester gives your Semester Performance Index (SPI). The weighted average of these SPIs gives your Cumulative Performance Index (CPI). CPI gives an overall impression of your academic performance and plays an important role in course/project allotment in later semesters, not to mention internships and placements.\n",

So do make it a point to be regular in all courses.\n",

Starting from third semester, you will be allowed to take up courses in any discipline that you might happen to be interested in (say, Electrical Engineering or Biology) through their Minor courses. You can earn a Minor in a specific discipline by doing a fixed number of extra courses in that discipline.

In case you want to do the same thing within your BTech/BS department, you can do so under the regular Dual Degree Programme.

At the end of each semester, the student gets an SPI (Semester Performance Index) which is an average of the grades in each of the courses he/she had registered for in that semester, weighted with the credits of those courses respectively. CPI (Cumulative Performance Index) is a weighted average of all the SPIs (till date) weighted on the number of total credits each semester.\n",

Also, it is important for all students to attend classes during the first week of each semester, except for genuine medical reasons. When medical problems arise, the student is advised to inform the mentor and the professors concerned if he/she is missing classes. Professors might require medical certificates issued or authenticated by the IITB Hospital or other supporting documents in such cases.\n",

Due to the competitive environment here, we have often seen students, who have until now always topped their class, find it difficult to obtain grades that meet their expectations. This has often led to students experiencing excessive pressure or students adopting an indifferent attitude which further reduces their academic performance. We hope that you would encourage your ward to put his/ her best foot forward - put in the best effort from his/her side.\n",

The general lifestyle of students includes a lot of extracurricular activities in the fields of sports, cultural and technical activities, at intra-hostel, inter-hostel and inter-college events. The environment here is very conducive to growth and our institute has  some of the best facilities across all other colleges/institutes in India. So, we encourage students to take up whatever interests them, and we request you to support them in their choices. There is enough time in a normal IIT student’s day to fit in both academics and extracurricular activities without much stress. But, at the same time, it is advised that care must be taken to ensure proper time management such that academics are not neglected because of such activities.\n",

Many students find it difficult getting used to a roommate and hostel life for the first time. Sometimes, cultural, social and language differences further delay the settling in process. As mentors, we help the freshmen have a smooth transition so that this settling-in process is as short as possible and your ward feels comfortable in this new setting quickly.\n",
